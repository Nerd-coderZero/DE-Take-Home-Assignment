# TRP Priority Calculation for Cricket Matches

This project implements a Python script to calculate the TRP (Television Rating Point) priority for cricket matches based on various factors such as Series Type, Rivalry, Teams, Match Category, Format, and more.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: The main Python script that calculates the TRP scores.
- **Match Dump-DE Take home assignment (1).xlsx**: The input data file containing match details.
- **TRP_Explanation.md**: A detailed explanation of the approach, assumptions, and edge cases handled in the project.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the `main.py` script to calculate and sort the TRP scores for the matches.

## Requirements

All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Assumptions and Simplifications

The TRP calculation is based on the weights assigned to various factors, which are subjective and based on assumptions. For more details, refer to the `TRP_Explanation.md` file.
